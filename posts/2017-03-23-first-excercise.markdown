Evaluate one of the following IDEs (as listed on the [haskell-wiki](https://wiki.haskell.org/IDEs)):

* various IntelliJ plugins for Haskell
* EclipseFP plugin for Eclipse IDE
* Colorer plugin for Eclipse IDE
* Leksah
* KDevelop
* Vim
* Emacs
* Atom

for the following criteria / features:

* [multi-package project problem](http://andrewufrank.blogspot.co.at/2017/03/the-haskell-tool-stack-for-multi.html) is solvable
* automatical rebuild
* function-documentation readily available (e.g. via mouse-over)
* error messages / notifications for non-correct function invocations / syntax
* ghci integration
* stack-integration
* auto-completion
* performance (e.g. during startup)
* usability
* support for refactoring

and update the [haskell-wiki](https://wiki.haskell.org/IDEs) accordingly.

Also, practice your stack-foo on the multi-package project problem. :)
